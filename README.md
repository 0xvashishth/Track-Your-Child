# Inspiration 😎
## ## What it does ⚙️
- A financial website to teach your kids about money management! Give them assignments (chores) to finish in exchange for money. Once they have accumulated enough coins, they can use them to purchase stocks as well as rewards!

- No actual money will be wasted in this market, so don't worry! We built a completely virtual stock market so that the kids could learn and practice investing wisely. It's usually a good idea to start them young, as some people assert.

- The tasks their children are given, the number of coins they earn for completing each activity, the incentives that are accessible, and the advancement of their children are all completely under parental control.

## How we built it 🏡
- After brainstorming my idea for a bit and creating a prototype on paper, I began developing TrackYourChild! We decided to go with a web application that incorporated the MERN tech stack.

## Challenges we ran into 🏃‍♂️
- Creating a backend server was a challenging task.
- Integrating the Front-End and Backend turned out to be more difficult than it would have been.
- The schema was slightly tricky to get right and I spent a lot of time struggling with it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- The UI we were able to create in this project is one that we are all proud of. 
- The whole project is done in just a span of 36 hours.

## What we learned
- We learned a ton about web APIs, JavaScript, and how to handle stressful situations while being sleep deprived.
- Also learned how to use custom domain in Replit.

## What's next for Track-Your-Child 💸
- The next step is to make an app more responsive.
- I want to add email functionality with twilio(sendgrid integration)
- I want to manage the users in a good manner.
- Further investment features are also in the works!
